the oringal goal of this project 
hi this is a project done during the time in university learning about opengl this is next step of me learn how to change the pbg as well over impotion task
This is the step of how it work and what i done to make sure 

First thing this using PBR (Physically-based Rendering) for the light and reflection. to give better reflection of the work.
second i am going be using Perlin noise for the dount which allow to look like ants has been eating the food items, or some hold it
thrid is to add some textures to model to give a nicer look

there are the goal for this project
also anycode from last coursework will be mark with //done on comp3015 coursework 1 so people know what new

the project now
So as this project deadline is due in tomoorw i had to focuse more on one thing which is getting pbr working and give a new effect that had not been seen 
so using the code that Mairus Varga has given for pbr i went to work create a new idea for the ligth to showcase a rand being used to ranmod gentert the model to different models in the cpp which allow the user to see and have bit of fun having random dount or pig(given by Mairus)  which also to show case how it adpet well when thing are changing this.
also some bug texture are currenly not working as i mess up when include it in pbr which need a fix but i going have to do a later on as this is running out of time for the deadline
